## About Me

Passionate about integrating Generative AI into connected products. As a Solution Architect for IoT and GenAI-based solutions at **Fluidra**, a leading swimming pool manufacturer, I love writing code that bridges technology and innovation. Open-source advocate and future tech enthusiast, committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Also a passionate teacher aiming to educate engineering graduates and inspire newcomers. As a guest faculty member with **CDAC**, I train PG Diploma students—engineering graduates or industry professionals—who aspire to grow in the connected product space. Dedicated to educating and inspiring the next generation of engineers.
